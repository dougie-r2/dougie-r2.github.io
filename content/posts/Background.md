What a day! I always contemplate starting my own blog for years. It was difficult journey for me. However with help of Hugo and Github Action(h/t to [Christopher Hart](https://chrisjhart.com/Creating-A-Simple-Free-Blog-Hugo/)), I now have a blog. :smile:

I am not a genius, I don't have a good memory skill, I am not a hardworking person. I am more like a slow leaner.
But I don't give up easily.(Yeah, I do sometime give up :rofl:)


One of my life goal was just getting know what the Frouier transform is. 

I will write down what I think and what I know.  
This blog can be my library, my diary, and myself.

The question that I had while I was studying   
I have been through


In mathematics, you don't understand things. You just get used to them. - by John von Neumann

This is the life I think.
